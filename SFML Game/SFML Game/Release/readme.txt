IMPORTANT!!!!
MSI Afterburner has been found to cause issues. It tends to crash after a few levels. Please disable or uninstall MSI Afterburner
for an optimal experience.
The error message that shows up with it can appear anyway, it is an issue with OpenAL and is unavoidable. It also doesn't change
anything unless MSI Afterburner is active.
I am unaware of any similar programs also causing issues, however I would reccomend temporarily disabling them just to be safe.
